## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first attempt at one of these kinds of front-end challenges, and I tried my best to get it pixel perfect.

I found a nice, compact, and sensible CSS reset which I intend to use from here onwards.

### Continued development

My solution doesn't contain any re-usable styles or utility classes, so that's something I'd like to focus on next.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob)\
Kevin is an amazing teacher, and I based my solution on his many excellent examples.
